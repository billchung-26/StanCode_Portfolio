## ✨ Highlights and Core Skills

### 1. Image Processing & Manipulation

These projects focus on iterating through images and modifying them at the pixel level to achieve visual effects and analysis. 

* **Mirror Lake Reflection [mirror_lake.py](https://github.com/billchung-26/StanCode_Portfolio/blob/main/mirror_lake.py):** Implemented coordinate transformation logic to create a vertical mirror reflection, doubling the image height and copying pixels to create a lake effect.
* **Fire Detection Filter [fire.py](https://github.com/billchung-26/StanCode_Portfolio/blob/main/fire.py):** Developed a filter that detects potential fire pixels by comparing the red channel intensity against the average RGB intensity, highlighting them in pure red and converting non-fire areas to grayscale.

### 2. Data Structures, String & File Handling

These exercises cover essential I/O operations, text analysis, and sequential data processing.

* **File Data Analysis [file_reading.py](https://github.com/billchung-26/StanCode_Portfolio/blob/main/file_reading.py):** Programmed a utility to read data from a file, handle missing data ("Nan" entries), convert valid lines to numbers, and calculate the maximum, minimum, and average values.
* **DNA Complement Finder [complement.py](https://github.com/billchung-26/StanCode_Portfolio/blob/main/complement.py):** Used string iteration and conditional logic to implement the biological rule for finding the complementary strand of a DNA sequence (A↔T, C↔G).
* **String Scoring Utility [string_score.py](https://github.com/billchung-26/StanCode_Portfolio/blob/main/string_score.py):** Created a function that iterates over a string and assigns a score based on character type (digits=1, uppercase=2, lowercase=3) using built-in string methods (`isdigit`, `isupper`).

### 3. Structured Programming and Algorithms

Projects focusing on control flow, modularity, and algorithmic design.

* **ASCII Art Rocket [rocket.py](https://github.com/billchung-26/StanCode_Portfolio/blob/main/rocket.py):** Used function decomposition (`head`, `belt`, `upper`, `lower`) and nested loops to generate a scaled rocket figure purely from ASCII characters, demonstrating modular design and pattern generation.
* **Random Simulation [python_random_generator.py](https://github.com/billchung-26/StanCode_Portfolio/blob/main/python_random_generator.py):** Designed a program to simulate die rolls and use state flags (`can_add`) to count the number of consecutive identical results ("runs"), illustrating basic simulation logic.
